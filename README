This is a quick readme as I don't consider the code ready for use yet!
==========

1. Prerequisites
a) This is written in Python3 so ... yeah
b) MongoDB -- is used to store all the vulnerability information 
c) pyMongo -- obviously, if you need to connect to the MongoDB
d) sax -- for xml parsing


db_mgmt.py -p = populate the database, only run this on the first time
it takes all the XML files from NVD and pushes them into the MongoDB

dbmgmt.py -u = update the database.
it takes modified and recent XML files from NVD and merges them into the
existing MongoDB

search.py 
-p = search for product "microsoft" or "windows" should work, ideal is using
CPE notation, e.g. cisco:ios:12.1
-f = free text search (in vulnerability summary), currently only supports single
word searches
-o = output (currently html,csv,json are supported)

examples
./search.py -p cisco:ios:12.4
./search.py -f nagios
./search.py -p microsoft:windows_7 -o html
